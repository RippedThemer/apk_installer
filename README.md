* Navigate to your Applications if not already there and choose the APK Installer app.
* Finally click on Change All... button in the same Info window.

## Installation

* Make sure to have Android SDK downloaded and PATH set up in `.bash_profile` (See how to do it [below](#Setting_up_.bash_profile)).
* Download the `APK Installer.app` and drag and drop it to your Applications.


## Setting up .bash_profile

* Open Terminal and write 
`touch ~/.bash_profile`
* Then 
`open -e ~/.bash_profile` which will open EditText. Do not close it yet.
* Open Finder.
* Navigate to the folder containing Android SDK.
* Drag and drop **platform-tools** folder from Finder window to Terminal window.
* Copy that path. Typically it looks like `/Users/<yourname>/Downloads/android-sdk/platform-tools`
* Go back to open EditText document and paste there the copied path prepending it with `export PATH=$PATH:`
* Save and close EditText document and Done!

Finally you should have something like this:
`export PATH=$PATH:/Users/<yourname>/Downloads/android-sdk/platform-tools`
